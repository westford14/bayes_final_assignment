# Final Assignment R Code

The associated `final_assignment.R` code generates all the plots, models, and figures that 
are needed for the Final Assignment submission.  Below is an overview of the code, how to 
use it, and what is generated by running this code.

## Installation

Ensure that there is an up-to-date R code installed on your machine (the code will also
generate a `sessionInfo()` object so that library variations and installation variations 
can be assessed post-hoc).

Code has been written and tested on `R` `4.4.1` compiled on `macOS` `14.5` with an `arm`
chip. Detailed instructions on how to install `R` can be found [here](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html#How-can-R-be-obtained_003f).

If you're using [`RStudio`](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/), you can use
the following code to install all the needed libraries:

```R
pkgs <- rownames(installed.packages())
if (!("optparse" %in% pkgs)) install.packages(
  "optparse", repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org"
)
if (!("brms" %in% pkgs)) install.packages(
  "brms", repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org"
)
if (!("dplyr" %in% pkgs)) install.packages(
  "dplyr", repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org"
)
if (!("ggplot2" %in% pkgs)) install.packages(
  "ggplot2", repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org"
)
if (!("log4r" %in% pkgs)) install.packages(
  "log4r", repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org"
)
if (!("tidyverse" %in% pkgs)) install.packages(
  "tidyverse", repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org"
)
if (!("ggcorrplot" %in% pkgs)) install.packages(
  "ggcorrplot", repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org"
)
if (!("broom" %in% pkgs)) install.packages(
  "broom", repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org"
)
if (!("tidybayes" %in% pkgs)) install.packages(
  "tidybayes", repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org"
)
if (!("parallelly" %in% pkgs)) install.packages(
  "parallelly", repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org"
)
if (!("mgcv" %in% pkgs)) install.packages(
  "mgcv", repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org"
)
if (!("randomForest" %in% pkgs)) install.packages(
  "randomForest", repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org"
)
if (!("caret" %in% pkgs)) install.packages(
  "caret", repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org"
)
if (!("doParallel" %in% pkgs)) install.packages(
  "doParallel", repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org"
)
if (!("doSNOW" %in% pkgs)) install.packages(
  "doSNOW", repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org"
)
if (!("foreach" %in% pkgs)) install.packages(

  "doRNG", repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org"
)
```

## Code Overview

The code expects a `BostonHousing.Rdata` file to exist somewhere on your machine, but 
the code can be run either via `Rscript` or interactively through RStudio.

Below are the important variables to set:

* `seed` - the random seed (integer)
* `draws` - the number of draws to run BRMS (integer)
* `output` - the output directory for the saving models and diagnostics
* `file` - the input `BostonHousing.RData` file
* `cores` - the number of cores to use (if set to 0 the program will parallelize
            across a reasonable number of cores)
* `holdout` - the percentage to holdout for prior model fitting and validation

An example of running the code via `Rscript` is below:

```bash
Rscript final_assignment.R --file BostonHousing.RData
```

This will set reasonable default arguments for all variables, but if you would
like to see this expanded to all default variables:

```bash
Rscript final_assignment.R --file BostonHousing.RData --seed 42 --draws 10000 --output . --cores 0 --holdout 0.1
```

There will be a number of log messages generated, but once the script is finished 
running you will result in a folder structure like:

```
(base) ➜  final_assignment tree .
.
├── README.md
├── BostonHousing.RData
├── analysis
│   ├── ...
├── final_assignment.R
├── bayes_models
│   ├── ...
├── diagnostics
│   ├── ...
```

The folders created are summarized below:

* `analysis` - overview data diagnostics and analytics 
* `bayes_models` - the `brms` models saved along with coefficients and LOO comparisons
* `diagnostics` - autocorrelation, trace, ppc, and coefficient plots
* `prior_models` - the models with just the priors sampled

## Prior Selection and Model Analysis

We initially set weakly informative `normal(0, 10)` priors on the `β` coefficients, 
as we had no strong prior expectations about the size of their effects. However, after fitting
an initial model, we observed that many of the effect sizes exceeded our set standard deviation
of `10` and were thus constrained by the priors. To address this, we changed the priors to wider
`student t(3, 0, 50)` priors. Although these priors seem quite diffuse, this choice was justified
because it allowed the posterior distributions to extend to a wider range of values (-60 in one example).
[A more detailed analysis of this can be found in the poster presentation where we show the overlap of
the posterior and prior density functions to show that our selection of priors was justified.]. 
We also decided to use the default priors of `brms` for the `sigma`, `intercept` and `smooth components`
as we did not have any prior knowledge of these parameters and could not find good literature to 
inform starting priors. 

This is also coupled with us using non-default parameters when we fit our `brm` model. 
The initial model showed poor convergence, indicated by a high `R-hat` statistic, low effective
sample sizes (`ESS`), and a considerable amount of divergent transitions – all threatening the 
validity of our results. To improve convergence, we increased the number of iterations to
`10,000` draws with `5,000` warmup draws and also set a smaller step size (`adapt_delta = 0.95`)
to further ensure the robustness of our analysis.
